# TICK lab

A ready-made [TICK stack](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/) built from official Docker images for learning purposes.


## Usage

Run `docker-compose up -d` and go have fun.


## Configuration

### Telegraf

Sends "builtin" inputs (e.g. `cpu, disk, diskio, kernel, mem, processes, swap`) to database `builtin_metrics` and
any other inputs except these to `custom_metrics`. All metrics are sent to stdout in line format, you can see them
by typing `docker-compose logs -f telegraf`.

Accepts metrics in the influxdb line protocol format at 8092/udp and 8094/tcp. Both listeners are exposed to the host.
